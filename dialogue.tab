sdate1_catch_57421413		I caught a tuna.	game/script.rpy	236	"[what]"
sdate1_catch_caa3d424	s	Nice work! That's a pretty big one. The fish around here tend to be small, so that's quite the feat.	game/script.rpy	238	s "[what]"

sdate1_catch_f42d2ce1		Shauna nodded in agreement, her hands tightening around her fishing rod.	game/script.rpy	246	"[what]"

sdate1_away_d495f565	y	You'll get 'em next time.	game/script.rpy	266	y "[what]"
sdate1_away_230d8631		She smiles at that, leaning against the dock's railing with her rod still in hand.	game/script.rpy	267	"[what]"
sdate1_away_ec220e91	s	Maybe we're both just having an off day.	game/script.rpy	269	s "[what]"
sdate1_away_3f718603	y	Maybe.	game/script.rpy	271	y "[what]"
sdate1_away_245bb8a7		It's quiet for a few moments.	game/script.rpy	272	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_39ee3e9d	s	So tell me about yourself. How did you get into fishing?	game/script.rpy	277	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_868c19a8	y	Ah, it's not much of a story. Kind of silly, really.	game/script.rpy	279	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_a91a9523	s	I don't mind, tell me anyways.	game/script.rpy	281	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_ae7f22e8	y	Well...	game/script.rpy	283	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_4c76490e	y	This is embarrassing but...	game/script.rpy	286	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_70d0e637	y	I've always loved catching fish in video games, ever since I was a kid.	game/script.rpy	287	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_5676bab2	y	I found it really fun waiting for a tug and reeling it in.	game/script.rpy	288	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_f6ff401d	y	At a certain point, I wanted to try it for real.	game/script.rpy	289	y "[what]"

sdate1_merge_d7ba9d07	s	Don't you think it's pretty cool that one hobby managed to get you into another one?	game/script.rpy	296	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_089a03d7	y	I guess so, I never really thought of it like that.	game/script.rpy	298	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_ba9621b4	s	Do you still play video games?	game/script.rpy	300	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_f0bc9dc6	y	Yeah, every now and then. Not as much as I used to.	game/script.rpy	302	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_fe1cd634	s	I see.	game/script.rpy	304	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_b85cf0f4	s	Maybe I'll have to get you to show me one of these fishing games sometime.	game/script.rpy	306	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_3e08dc96	y	Yeah, maybe you'll have more luck catching virtual fish.	game/script.rpy	308	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_bb9f373e	s	Hey!	game/script.rpy	310	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_a862a66d		Despite her incredulous tone, Shauna couldn't help but smile.	game/script.rpy	312	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_75661760		I smiled too.	game/script.rpy	313	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_fe8c4e7a	s	Listen, unlike you, I've been a fisher since birth!	game/script.rpy	315	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_7d30e80d	s	My dad was a sailor, and my mom's the best angler I know.	game/script.rpy	316	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_d32fdf37	s	So needless to say, fishing is in my blood.	game/script.rpy	318	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_7770d7ee	s	I've been going on seaside adventures ever since I was just a little tot.	game/script.rpy	319	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_3805c99c	y	Wow, that's cool. How old were you when you went on your first fishing trip?	game/script.rpy	321	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_38858d3f	s	Hmm... hard to say. Maybe when I was three or four?	game/script.rpy	323	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_c05665b4	s	My parents got me started pretty young.	game/script.rpy	325	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_01c100df		She sighed, glaring down at her rod.	game/script.rpy	327	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_9e95a579	s	Not that you'd be able to tell!	game/script.rpy	329	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_0624da51		I can't help but laugh at that.	game/script.rpy	331	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_532239a7	y	Aww... Don't be so hard on yourself. Everyone has their off days.	game/script.rpy	332	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_00902391		I reach out and wrap my arm around her shoulder, shifting a bit closer to her with a reassuring smile.	game/script.rpy	333	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_f5470e92		She blushes, and there's a shift in the air. I try to think of what to say to fill the silence.	game/script.rpy	335	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_e092f059	y	I've always lived by the seaside in a rural little village.	game/script.rpy	337	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_bf980a7a	y	With the ocean so close, it seemed like the natural thing to do.	game/script.rpy	338	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_0b4011b5	y	All the other kids I knew growing up would go fishing in the summer.	game/script.rpy	339	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_f671ff1a	y	So I did too. And eventually, I realized it was a lot of fun.	game/script.rpy	340	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_ed8ee77b	y	And a nice way to save on groceries, too.	game/script.rpy	341	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_97cc6d95	y	My parents were a big fan of my newfound talent, so we'd spend a lot of suppers eating fried fish together.	game/script.rpy	342	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_9aa45676	s	Aww, that's sweet.	game/script.rpy	344	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_345de3c3	s	It was sort of similar for me... my parents were always really supportive.	game/script.rpy	346	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_d8204685	y	Yeah? When did you start fishing?	game/script.rpy	348	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_df3da005	s	Oh cod, I don't even know if I remember. I was just a tiny little thing.	game/script.rpy	350	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_c281e7b1	s	My mom has always loved fishing in the sea, and my day was a sailor.	game/script.rpy	352	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_d0bb5aab	s	They were a match made in heaven. You're not gonna believe this, but I swear they got married on a boat.	game/script.rpy	353	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_82e238d5	s	And not a big yacht or anything fancy! A little canoe, if you can believe it.	game/script.rpy	355	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_01ee9660		I wasn't totally certain if I {i}did{/i} believe it, but I continued to listen along anyways.	game/script.rpy	357	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_d076b3f6	s	I can barely remember it, but they must have taught me to fish when I was real young.	game/script.rpy	359	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_921a8061	s	Because I've been fishing for as long as I can remember...	game/script.rpy	360	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_ab5b12d7	s	Probably learned how to fish around the same time I learned to tie my shoes, that's how ingrained it feels.	game/script.rpy	362	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_1f8af6b7	y	You say that, but I don't see any fish in your bucket...	game/script.rpy	364	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_73585ebc		She elbowed me in the ribs and gave me an indignant look.	game/script.rpy	366	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_3358683d	s	Watch it, [player_name]! Don't be saucy.	game/script.rpy	367	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_13c75fee		Despite her warning, she didn't look too pressed.	game/script.rpy	369	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_a3405bf8	s	Anyways, like I was saying. Fishing is a lifelong passion for me.	game/script.rpy	371	s "[what]"
sdate1_merge_afbb17ae	y	That's sweet. Honestly, I could listen to you talk about this all day. Your passion is really charming.	game/script.rpy	373	y "[what]"
sdate1_merge_bfaff693		I can't help but smile as I wrap my arm around Shauna's shoulder, shifting a bit closer to her.	game/script.rpy	375	"[what]"
sdate1_merge_f5470e92_1		She blushes, and there's a shift in the air. I try to think of what to say to fill the silence.	game/script.rpy	376	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_86a965f5	y	You may not have caught anything today, but you definitely reeled me in.	game/script.rpy	385	y "[what]"
sdate1_ending_af9a1ea9		She rolls her eyes and laughs. Her smile is infectious.	game/script.rpy	387	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_729bbd22	s	Yeah well... You're quite the catch yourself, you know.	game/script.rpy	389	s "[what]"
sdate1_ending_22aa8aa6		She kisses me on the cheek.	game/script.rpy	390	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_17c298b9		There's a comfortable silence for a few moments before she speaks again.	game/script.rpy	391	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_bb6fa1ba	s	Thank you for joining me [player_name], I had an amazing time today. I'd love to go on another fishing date with you sometime soon.	game/script.rpy	393	s "[what]"
sdate1_ending_c8fd728d	y	Who says we have to call it a day yet?	game/script.rpy	394	y "[what]"
sdate1_ending_8fb8f71c	y	Let's stay here a little longer... See where the day takes us. What do you say?	game/script.rpy	395	y "[what]"
sdate1_ending_2b582c30		She smiles, her eyes twinkling.	game/script.rpy	397	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_45922580	s	I'd like that.	game/script.rpy	398	s "[what]"
sdate1_ending_21c7021c		Her fingers intertwine with mine, and her head leans against my shoulder as we watch the sunset together.	game/script.rpy	399	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_f72f121d		I try to say something smooth, but the words get jumbled.	game/script.rpy	408	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_c4a7a4cd	y	You uh… you… fuck. You're kinda like... a fish? I mean...	game/script.rpy	409	y "[what]"
sdate1_ending_2a770c09		She makes a face.	game/script.rpy	411	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_06c7e99f	s	Uhh, you good?	game/script.rpy	412	s "[what]"
sdate1_ending_b8913d09		I blurt out the worst possible thing.	game/script.rpy	413	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_2a9ede46	y	I just—I feel like I've caught you, you know? Like, I set the bait, and now you're right where I want you.	game/script.rpy	414	y "[what]"
sdate1_ending_36bb4bd5	s	Dude.	game/script.rpy	416	s "[what]"
sdate1_ending_c3406b4b	s	...What.	game/script.rpy	417	s "[what]"
sdate1_ending_6ec6b777	y	Wait. I didn't mean it like that—	game/script.rpy	418	y "[what]"
sdate1_ending_f93b0a73	s	You scare me, [player_name].	game/script.rpy	419	s "[what]"
sdate1_ending_6b28800f		I made a terrible mistake.	game/script.rpy	420	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_fab75338		That day I learned that it's not just fish that fear me.	game/script.rpy	421	"[what]"
sdate1_ending_ff41600d		Women now fear me too.	game/script.rpy	422	"[what]"
molly_date1_286c3d72		We chatted for a while about fishing, farming, foraging, and more. Before I knew it, it was time for our date.	game/script.rpy	457	"[what]"
molly_date1_0e903fa4	m	I'm so glad you could make it. I love showing people around my favorite fishing spot.	game/script.rpy	459	m "[what]"
molly_date1_d0da1f55	y	Thanks for inviting me. This place is beautiful.	game/script.rpy	460	y "[what]"
molly_date1_0dbec99b	m	Right? The pond is perfect this time of year. The water's clear and the fish are really active.	game/script.rpy	462	m "[what]"
molly_date1_6171c8cf		I notice Molly has a picnic basket and some fishing gear set up nearby.	game/script.rpy	463	"[what]"
molly_date1_d589fa94	m	I brought some snacks and extra equipment. Have you ever been pond fishing before?	game/script.rpy	465	m "[what]"
molly_date1_8ca650ce	y	I mostly tend to fish from the coastline, but I've done a fair share of pond fishing as well.	game/script.rpy	469	y "[what]"
molly_date1_be7ac206	m	Oh, that's really interesting. I bet you have a lot of great fishing stories.	game/script.rpy	471	m "[what]"
molly_date1_57925342	y	I do. I won't get into them now, but maybe on our next date.	game/script.rpy	472	y "[what]"
molly_date1_0b051551	m	You're so forward. I kind of like it.	game/script.rpy	474	m "[what]"
molly_date1_2ed3e90d		She seems flustered for a moment before regaining her composure.	game/script.rpy	475	"[what]"
molly_date1_a77e33cd	y	Actually, this is my first time. I've only fished in the ocean before.	game/script.rpy	477	y "[what]"
molly_date1_2e985840	m	Interesting. It shouldn't be too much different, but I'd still be happy to show you the ropes.	game/script.rpy	479	m "[what]"
molly_date1_91dd775d	m	Anyways, for now, why don't we get started? Let's both cast our lines and see what we can catch.	game/script.rpy	481	m "[what]"
molly_date1_3a541515		I grab some bait from Molly's basket, and we both cast our lines into the pond.	game/script.rpy	482	"[what]"
molly_date1_ad6b555f		For a few moments, the water is still.	game/script.rpy	483	"[what]"
molly_date1_db83a5c9		...Until suddenly, I feel a tug on my line.	game/script.rpy	484	"[what]"
mdate1_catch_e4a314d0		I caught a carp.	game/script.rpy	497	"[what]"
mdate1_catch_9044c909	m	Wow, nice catch! That's one of the bigger ones I've seen in this pond.	game/script.rpy	499	m "[what]"
mdate1_catch_03850bb9	y	Thanks! The water's so clear, I could see it coming for the lure.	game/script.rpy	501	y "[what]"
mdate1_catch_3463724a	m	You're a natural at this. Want to try for another one?	game/script.rpy	502	m "[what]"
mdate1_away_3a50bb07		The fish got away...	game/script.rpy	507	"[what]"
mdate1_away_439df3bb	m	Hey, don't worry about it. That's just how fishing goes sometimes.	game/script.rpy	509	m "[what]"
mdate1_away_2fd4d248	y	Yeah, I guess you're right.	game/script.rpy	510	y "[what]"
mdate1_away_d9650f3c	m	Besides, the real fun is in the experience, right? Just being out here, enjoying nature...	game/script.rpy	512	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_c2abffa8	m	You know, I've been coming to this pond since I was little.	game/script.rpy	517	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_80df9ed2	y	Really? How did you discover it?	game/script.rpy	518	y "[what]"
mdate1_merge_f8ef2ed7	m	It's actually a funny story...	game/script.rpy	520	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_2ee5c859	m	I used to help my grandmother collect wild herbs and berries. One summer, I wandered off a little too far while looking for the sweetest blackberries.	game/script.rpy	522	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_6f59d5ee	m	Before I knew it, I was completely lost. I was too stubborn to call for help, so I kept walking, hoping I'd recognize something.	game/script.rpy	524	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_bf720a7e	m	That's when I found this pond. The water was so still, the air smelled like wildflowers... I almost forgot I was lost.	game/script.rpy	526	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_f580168a	m	Eventually, my grandmother found me sitting under an old oak tree, watching the dragonflies dance over the water.	game/script.rpy	528	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_a0c3d102	m	She just lauged and said, 'Looks like the forest wanted to show you something special today.'	game/script.rpy	529	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_35005efa	m	And I think she was right.	game/script.rpy	531	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_a5d4b066	y	What a sweet story. I get why this place is so special to you.	game/script.rpy	533	y "[what]"
mdate1_merge_533005e1	m	I come here whenever I need a moment of quiet. Just the water, the wind, the little creatures scurrying around…	game/script.rpy	535	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_eb30c8fc	m	Speaking of which, I saw a heron here the other morning. It was so graceful, standing right at the water's edge. Barely moved at all, just waiting… watching…	game/script.rpy	536	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_b679ad06	m	Kind of like you right now.	game/script.rpy	538	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_d1642ce7	y	Huh?	game/script.rpy	539	y "[what]"
mdate1_merge_b5a5dcab	m	You've been staring at me for a while now. Waiting, watching…	game/script.rpy	541	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_b210ccb1	m	If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to reel {i}me{/i} in.	game/script.rpy	543	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_dbad6437		A quiet moment settles between you. The sounds of the pond fill the space—gentle ripples on the water, the rustling of leaves in the breeze.	game/script.rpy	544	"[what]"
mdate1_merge_7581e536	m	Well?	game/script.rpy	546	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_3b615b38		The silence lingers. This is your moment.	game/script.rpy	547	"[what]"
mdate1_merge_8d6f7250		I lean in closer, watching as her blush deepens.	game/script.rpy	555	"[what]"
mdate1_merge_476a5e53	y	You know, I think I caught something better than a fish today.	game/script.rpy	556	y "[what]"
mdate1_merge_7519bd35	m	Oh? And what's that?	game/script.rpy	557	m "[what]"
mdate1_merge_224c9a42	y	A chance to know you better.	game/script.rpy	558	y "[what]"
